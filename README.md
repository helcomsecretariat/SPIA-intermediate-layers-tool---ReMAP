SPIA intermediate layers tool

The SPIA intermediate layers tool was developed under the ReMAP project to automatically rasterize input datasets representing the spatial distribution of human uses and ecosystem components, or intermediate layers, within the area of analysis. Its objective is to simplify the use of the SPIA tool (https://github.com/helcomsecretariat/Cumulative-impact-Assessment-Toolbox), by incorporating all the geoprocessing steps applied to each input dataset, as well as the aggregation processes into an automated process. Furthermore, this tool allows the replication of the methodology to different sea areas by providing a template with the data format used by the tool.

The tool was conceptualized to be applied in three different sea areas covering different scales, the Baltic Sea Region, the Northwest Mediterranean and Galicia. The requirements for the different datasets are based on the characteristics of those areas, however, the tool can be adapted to be applied in any location, given that local characteristics (e.g. species, habitats) are incorporated in the tool.
